Distance Measuring and Obstacle Detection Device
This project implements an Obstacle detection system on Tinkercad using an Arduino Uno R3. The system employs an ultrasonic distance sensor with four pins to measure distance. Three LEDs (red, yellow, and green) with 330Î© resistors provide visual feedback on obstacle proximity. The green LED signifies a clear zone (distance<100cm and >75cm), yellow indicates caution (distance between 50cm and 75cm), and red signifies an obstacle detected (distance < 50cm).
